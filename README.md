### Markdown basics
Text formatting and readability matter. It's up to you to choose a particular style, but remember to make it readable. Using markdown in your repo is a good idea.

### Material-specific Requirements
The course includes links to different learning materials - video courses, tutorials, articles etc. We suggest the following approach to those materials:

1. Reading: for each article you are required to read please post the answers to the following questions in your respective repo. Don't worry, your answers will not be graded. It's just a way to reflect on what you have learned.

   - _name (at least) one thing that was **new** to you_
   - _name (at least) one thing that **surprised** you_
   - _name (at least) one thing you intend to **use in the future**_
  
2. Online courses: finish all tasks, add your reflection about them into README.

3. Videos: same as for the reading; watch the video, answer three questions.

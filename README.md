### Markdown basics
Text formatting and readability matter. It's up to you to choose a particular style, but remember to make it readable. Using markdown in your repo is a good idea.

### Material-specific Requirements
The course includes links to different learning materials - video courses, tutorials, articles etc. We suggest the following approach to those materials:

1. Reading: for each article you are required to read please post the answers to the following questions in your respective repo. Don't worry, your answers will not be graded. It's just a way to reflect on what you have learned.

   - _name (at least) one thing that was **new** to you_
   - _name (at least) one thing that **surprised** you_
   - _name (at least) one thing you intend to **use in the future**_
  
2. Online courses: finish all tasks, add your reflection about them into README.

3. Videos: same as for the reading; watch the video, answer three questions.


# Git and GitHub

1. [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

During this course:

1. I realized that 'versions' is not only about highly specialized software such as git and version control to varying degree can be found 
in almost every program. 

2. I worked with versions of a document (called revisions) in google docs.

3. I repeated and clarified the basic concepts of git (working directory, index, repository areas and their workflow).

4. I updated git version and checked config info.

5. I discovered new terminal commands:
   - `rmdir` to remove directory;
   - `ls -a` to list hidden files;
   - `mkdir -p parent/child` to create nested directories with single command.
   
6. I created local repository for test directory using `git init` and got acquainted with the contents of the hidden .git folder.

7. Installed and first used next packages for linting - [HTML linter](https://htmlhint.com/), [CSS linter](https://stylelint.io/), [JS linter](https://eslint.org/).
